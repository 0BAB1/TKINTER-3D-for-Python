# 3D FOR TKINTER

this python script will allow you to get basic 3d prewiews on a python canvas or your tkinter projects, there aree no dependencies to install, only tkinter and math !

## old project ..

This project was one on my first on python ... And it was actually pretty big !

An entire 3D engine that renders onto a simple tkinter canvas to reduce setup command and boilerplate code to the *bare minimum*. It responds to mouse mouvement and has a camera ! The logic behind it is completely custom, i imagined the architecture by myself because we had no internet at my internship (proxy blocked it) (yes i was not really supposed to work on that haha)

It was an application of basic linear algebra we studied in class.

I never really finished this project. The next step was to add shaders ! I'm not doing it today because i do not need to learn anymore and there is no need for a CPU based 3D engine on "vanilla python" with no GPU acceleration whatsoever.
