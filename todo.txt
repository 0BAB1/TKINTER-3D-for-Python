HELLO, HERE IS MY TODO LIST

add project explaination on readme.md
add shape object (add nodes (transform, shaders, mesh, etc...))
make the add_surf code shorter (reliable math of surface, STUDY TOPOLOGY YOU MORRON)
direct shapes adding
math function (bruh) (goes with toppology)
rework origin
fix del shape issue
objectify mesh
add culling, shaders (objectify everithing i guess)
WE HAVE TO ADD CAMERA BEFORE BACK FACE CULLING? HERE IS ARTICLE : https://jeux.developpez.com/faq/3d/?page=culling
give the rotation method a costom rotation origin (relative to the object)
make a common object with transform() method for space, camera and shape
