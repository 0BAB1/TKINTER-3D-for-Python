HELLO, HERE IS MY TODO LIST

add project explaination on readme.md
add camera
--big math work :--
    add shape object (add nodes (transform, shaders, mesh, etc...))
    make the add_surf code shorter (reliable math of surface, STUDY TOPOLOGY YOU MORRON)
    math function (bruh) (goes with topology)
direct shapes adding
rework origin
re-think rendering
bitmap instead of canvas maybe ?
