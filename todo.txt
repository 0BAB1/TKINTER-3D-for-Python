HELLO, HERE IS MY TODO LIST

TO DO:

avoid close / back camera render bugs
optimize the camera mouvement
add z-buffer
add project explaination on readme.md
(add nodes (transform, shaders, mesh, etc...))
make the add_surf code shorter (reliable math of surface, STUDY TOPOLOGY YOU MORRON)
math function (bruh) (goes with toppology)
fix del shape issue
objectify mesh
add culling, shaders (objectify everithing i guess)
WE HAVE TO ADD CAMERA BEFORE BACK FACE CULLING? HERE IS ARTICLE : https://jeux.developpez.com/faq/3d/?page=culling
give the rotation method a costom rotation origin (relative to the object)
make a common object with transform() method for space, camera and shape



WORK IN PROGRESS:


OVER:

-add shape object
-better binds : tkinter.fdex.eu/doc/event.html



FORGET:

rework origin
direct shapes adding
stock angles by vector director ?
